-Prompt user if they wish to save a file, after they changed something
-Once the program is close to being programmed, add a condition that prevent the user from running the script without a robot connected
        -Make this a last minute thing so that I'll have debugged crashes that could potentially happen

-Program sometimes crashes when 'add command' is clicked
