######   TO DO    #####
-Do not prompt user if they are deleting an event that has no commands inside it

-Once the program is close to being programmed, add a condition that prevent the user from running the script without a robot connected
        -Make this a last minute thing so that I'll have debugged crashes that could potentially happen

-Stop the what-the-hell random crashes
