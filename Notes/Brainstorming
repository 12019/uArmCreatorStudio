##### BRAINSTORMING #####
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


For video class:
    - I want to be able to show a stream of all processed objects, with a filter around them, displaying the object.
    - To do this, I need to know what filters to apply, how they will look, and apply them BEFORE the frame is turned
        into a pixmap
    - All logic commands will originate from one file, vision and more.
    - All vision commands will at some point use a function from a vision library of some sort
    - It's possible to have frames be constantly updating, and drawing over a rectangle from the last correct filter
        - This would lead to some lag issues, but wouldn't lead to FPS lag that could be sort of jarring
        - To do this, all drawing commands would have to be standardized in some way. (Drawing a rectangel, circle, etc)
        - The VideoStream library could have a dictionary with "name" and "filtertype" and "location" and just apply
               those filters to every frame.
               - A function could be made that would vStream.setFilter(name, type, location) that would add new filters
                   or just update ones that already exist
               - All filters would have to be applied on the frame that will be going to the camera widget, and no logic


For Interpreter Class:
    - I could make  the interpreter class sort of be a throwaway sort of deal, where you start it up when "play" is
        pressed, feed it the latest commands, initiate a thread to run it, all in one fell swoop, then close it when
        the "stop" button is pressed.
        - Pros/cons: Perhaps might lead to lag on bigger projects. How else would I make it seperate though?
        - With big data items such as object recognition where entire photos are loaded, how might I handle it?
               - Perhaps with an "environment" that has objects and such loaded, and is loaded once at the start of the
                    program, and holds any memory objects that don't change often. Then the GUI could interact with this
                    - The environment would have "add object" "delete object" "load object" "save object" variables
                    - It could be the interface for the computer vision GUI module that will be made later
                    - It would have an Interface thing in it, and this interface would be

    - Things for computer vision could have hundreds of photos attached to objects, who knows.
    - The interpreter has to:
        - Take a saveFile of an EventList and it's correpsonding CommandLists and do useful things
        - Be able to have small and large memory objects loaded in the GUI.
        - Start and stop quickly.
        - "Objects" could have a name associated to them. For example, the user names a poker card "Ace of Spades" and
            this has multiple pictures, arrays, and variables associated with it. All that information is under some
            kind of "Object" class that has a name on it.
            - These objects would be held by some class, maybe the Interpreter class?
            - These objects can be created by some tool seperate from the interpreter class
            -
