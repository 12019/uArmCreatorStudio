    Environment is passed to a class, do not save it to the class, instead pull what is needed from there and save
    that to the class instead.


    Environment holds the following thing and handles their shutdown:
        - VideoStream object
        - Vision object
        - Robot object
        - ObjectManager object


    THE ENVIRONMENT DOES NOT HOLD THE INTERPRETER, BY DESIGN: Since an Interpreter can run an interpreter inside of it,
