This software was designed by Alexander Thiel

The software was designed originaly for use with a robot arm, particularly uArm (Made by uFactory, ufactory.cc)
It is completely open source, so feel free to take it and use it as a base for your own projects.

If you make any cool additions, feel free to share!

    """
    Environment is a singleton. Do not create more than one! It is intended to help cope with the needs of GUI
    programming, where at any point I might need access to the robot, video, or settings. However, some rules apply: if
    Environment is passed to a class, do not save it to the class, instead pull what is needed from there and save
    that to the class instead.


    Environment holds the following thing and handles their shutdown:
        - VideoStream object
        - Vision object
        - Robot object
        - ObjectManager object


    THE ENVIRONMENT DOES NOT HOLD THE INTERPRETER, BY DESIGN: Since an Interpreter can run an interpreter inside of it,
    recursively, then the environment must not hold an interpreter. They are seperate. An Interpreter can hold an
    environment, however.


    Rules of thumb:
        - Objects that do not change while the interpreter is running are stored in Environment
            - Vision Objects
            - Movement Paths
        - Objects that are added and modified while interpeter is running are stored in the Interpeter
            - Variables generated by commands
            - "on the fly" vision objects generated by commands
