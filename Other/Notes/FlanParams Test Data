I went through tons of different options for FlanParams to find the one that best coped with high numbers of descriptors
with the best time and match point count.

The best compromise I found was parameters of (3, 19, 1) with a good speed and better pts found than the documentation recommended parameters


Result format:
Time: Time between frames to run the matcher.knnMatcher algorithm
Pts:  How many points were found on an arbitrary object. In this case, King of Spades (while surrounded by other detailed objects to lag everything)
Parameters: flanParams in the format of  (table_number, key_size, multi_probe_level)
